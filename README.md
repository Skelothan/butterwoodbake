# butterwoodbake
Web development project for 67-250, where we were to make a new website for the Butterwood Bake Consortium, a bakery in Pittsburgh. Their original site is [here](https://www.thebutterwoodbakeconsortium.com/).

This site features mobile-responsiveness, Highcharts, Jquery lightboxes, and a non-functional but dynamic HTML form (the course did not cover making forms functional).
